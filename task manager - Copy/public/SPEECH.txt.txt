**Speech for Project Presentation:**

"Good [morning/afternoon] everyone,

Today, I am excited to present our project, the **Personal Productivity Tracker**. In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, managing tasks, goals, and events efficiently is crucial for productivity. Our project provides a seamless solution by allowing users to track their daily activities, set long-term goals, and schedule important events.

### **Technology Stack:**
We have used **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to build an interactive user interface. The project features a **dark mode toggle, task categorization, and a goal-setting system**, ensuring a user-friendly experience. The application stores data using **local storage**, eliminating the need for a backend while maintaining functionality.

### **Software Development Process:**
We followed the **Incremental Model**, where we started with core functionalities like task management and gradually added features such as goal tracking and event scheduling. This approach allowed continuous improvement and testing at each stage.

### **Key Features:**
- **Task Management:** Users can add, prioritize, and complete tasks efficiently.
- **Goal Tracking:** Yearly and quarterly goal-setting options for long-term productivity.
- **Event Scheduling:** Users can add and manage events with specific dates and times.
- **Dark Mode:** Enhances user experience with theme customization.

In conclusion, this project is a step towards better time management and productivity. We plan to enhance it further by integrating cloud storage and user authentication for a personalized experience.

Thank you! I am open to any questions."
