I'll create a comprehensive productivity tracking application that includes task management, goal tracking, and event scheduling.



I've created a comprehensive Productivity Tracker with the following key features:

ðŸš€ Main Sections:
1. Tasks Management
   - Hourly Tasks
   - Weekly Tasks
   - Monthly Tasks
   - To-Do List

2. Goals Tracking
   - Yearly Goals
   - Quarterly Goals

3. Events Scheduling
   - Add events with date and time
   - Manage scheduled events

âœ¨ Features:
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Add, edit, and delete tasks/goals/events
- Mark tasks/goals as complete
- Priority setting
- Deadline tracking
- Responsive design
- Separate sections with navigation

ðŸ”¥ Technical Highlights:
- Uses React hooks (useState)
- Responsive layout
- Dynamic form handling
- State management for different item types
- Flexible input for tasks, goals, and events

Considerations for Production:
- Add persistent storage (localStorage/database)
- Implement more robust form validation
- Add edit functionality for existing items
- Create more detailed views and analytics

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the Productivity Tracker?
